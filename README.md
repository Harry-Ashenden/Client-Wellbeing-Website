# A Client's Multi-Discipline Wellbing Site  
This was a multi-page website I produced for a client providing comprehensive information about the services they offer. It is completely responsive so no matter what device it is viewed on, interested customers can access the site. A form with built in honey-pot provides an easy way of contact.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started this website from a basic template and worked with the client to design a base design with a colour palette and filler copy. From here I added all of the copy and images and ensured that the important functions such as a scrolling menu bar, bot protected contact form, and easy site navigation were in place. I then used media queries to ensure the design worked across all viewport sizes.

## Optimizations

To further enhance this project if there was more time I would have turned this website into a full-stack web app with integrated bookings and payments. Alas, the client was not quite set up for this kind of site just yet.

## Lessons Learned:

In this project I learnt how to streamline my workflow to be very efficient through creating reusable elements that I could tap into when it came to styling the site. This meant a more managable and organised CSS that coudl be implemented into the HTML.
