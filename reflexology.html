						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>Hi, I'm Hayley. I have worked in the beauty industry for over 25 years and in the year 2000, I qualified as a reflexologist. Reflexology aims to holistically restore balance to the body; this is achieved by applying pressure to certain points of the feet. Reflexology never claims to diagnose or cure however, I aim to offer a tailored, alternate means of healing to address everyone's individual specific needs. I will pinpoint areas on the feet where I can apply pressure to stimulate healing energy. This energy flows through the body's energetic pathways to the targeted areas of the body.</br></br>
						Having worked with many clients with a variety of ailments, I have gained invaluable experience in this field. I am very passionate about my work as we are all unique and this treatment is tailored to meet the needs of each client.</p>

								<h3>How can reflexology help you?</h3>
								<p>Reflexology is a safe, gentle, and non-invasive therapy, suitable for people of all ages. Frequently seen complaints that benefit from reflexology include, stress, anxiety, pain, bowel problems, plantar fasciitis, fertility issues, menstrual, menopausal problems, and many more.</br></br>
								I have valued client feedback as to how their body has responded to the treatment, feelings of calmness, enhanced sleep, deep relaxation, and improved symptoms leading to clients attending monthly treatments. It is always a privilege to be a part of my client's journey to improve their health and well-being.</p>
