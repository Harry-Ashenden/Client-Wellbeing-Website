					<h3>Hello and Welcome</h3>
					<p>I am a qualified Person-Centred counsellor that works with adults and young people based in the Rochford area. I offer face-to-face therapy in Rochford, telephone counselling and I also offer walk and talk therapy for clients who may benefit from using the outdoor environment for sessions. I am a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). I am fully insured and hold an enhanced DBS.</p>   

					<p> <img id="footstepsOnBeach" class="image right" src="images/Counselling-pic02-resized.jpg" alt="Footsteps in the sand on a beach with the seas in the background"> Life can be challenging at times and we can find ourselves in a dark and sometimes lonely places where we perhaps do not have a place to share honest thoughts and uncomfortable feelings. I offer that place, a safe confidential space free of judgement for you to open up and talk about those challenges. Over a period of time, I hope that we are able to build a trusting professional relationship together. It is my nature to be patient, empathetic and warm in my approach and through my own personal lived experiences I began my counselling process and found it to be very healing. I want to be able to offer my clients the opportunity to move forward and create a more fulfilled life.  I believe that the relationship between counsellor and client is the most important part of therapy, and I work to create a safe and comfortable environment where you can explore your most important needs.</p>

					<p>I have worked in many areas and can help with a wide range of difficulties. I have worked extensively with bereavement and loss, relationship issues, anxiety, depression and self-esteem. I am committed in my work to help you and welcome individuals of all backgrounds, cultures, faiths, genders, and sexualities.</p>

					<!-- First Session -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
							<h3>First Session</h3>
							<p>I offer a free introductory 10-15 minute phone call for us to get to know each other before we begin our work together. This is a good time to ask any questions you might have about starting therapy with me and we can also look at what you are looking to achieve from your sessions. There is no obligation to commit to therapy.</p>
