							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p><span id="headshot" class="image right"><img id="headshot" src="images/headshot-resized.jpeg" alt="Hayley's headshot" /> </span>Hi, I'm Hayley. I am a qualified Person-Centred counsellor and reflexologist, offering services in both individually. I have a passion for helping people, whether we're working through issues in counselling, or healing the body in a reflexology session. <br> </br>
							Within my counselling practice, I offer face-to-face therapy in Rochford, telephone counselling and walk and talk therapy. I am a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and fully insured with Towergate. I also have an enhanced DBS. <br></br>
							As a reflexologist, I offer a tailored, alternate means of healing to address everyone's individual specific needs. I pinpoint areas on the feet where I can apply pressure to stimulate healing energy, which flows through the body's energetic pathways to the targeted areas of the body.</p>

									<blockquote>Hayley is such a wonderful reflexologist. Each session is so relaxing, I always feel very peaceful afterwards. Reflexology with Hayley is a truly healing experience, one that I would thoroughly recommend. My mind and body is much happier since I started, and Hayley is so professional, kind and calming to be around.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>Hayley is brilliant and I couldn't recommend her enough. She is highly professional and extremely knowledgeable, she explained everything she found at the end of the treatment which was very informative. I first went to Hayley with menstrual pains, asthma and mental health issues. She professionally listened to me and then worked her magic on my feet. Hayley was calming and the treatment was very relaxing, my symptoms have hugely improved since. Hayley has a wonderful empathetic manner and has a naturally calming prescence. The treatment was so relaxing I fell asleep!</blockquote>

									<blockquote>I turned to Hayley through times of stress and anxiety. Hayley supported me through my journey of IVF, not just through the power of reflexology but emotional support as well. Not only is Hayley incredible at reflexology, she has a wonderful, kind nature. I have sessions monthly, and the appointments couldn't come around soon enough.</blockquote>
